Let's install Qtile.

You can copy and paste the code below into a bash script and execute it. You can also directly paste it into your terminal.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3-cffi libpangocairo-1.0-0 --reinstall
sudo apt install python3-full -y
sudo apt install python3-pip -y

# pip3 install xcffib==0.12.1 --break-system-packages
pip3 install xcffib==0.12.1

# pip3 install --no-cache-dir --no-build-isolation cairocffi==1.4.0 --break-system-packages
pip3 install --no-cache-dir --no-build-isolation cairocffi==1.4.0

# Install git if you don't have it installed
sudo apt install git

# pip3 install git+https://github.com/qtile/qtile --break-system-packages
pip3 install git+https://github.com/qtile/qtile

# Use apt if the above command does't work
# sudo apt install qtile

# You can also use pip like normal
# pip3 install qtile

echo "[Desktop Entry]
Name=Qtile
Comment=Qtile Session
Exec=~/.local/bin/qtile start
Type=Application
Keywords=wm;tiling" | sudo tee /usr/share/xsessions/qtile.desktop

echo "Qtile installation completed successfully. You can now logout and select Qtile from your session manager."

```

Make sure the `JetBrainsMono` Nerd Font is installed before logging into Qtile.

After the installation, reboot your system and choose Qtile on your login screen.

> The script above has been tested on Debian 12 x86_64, LMDE 5 (elsie) x86_64 and Ubuntu. If you run into any problems with the script, install everything line by line, if the xcffib and cairocffi packages fail to install, then add --break-system-packages at the end of the command and everything should work.

Once you have rebooted your system and logged into qtile, you should see the default qtile screen like the example below.
