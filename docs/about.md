# About

A minimal and fast Debian based Linux distro.

<p style="color: var(--vp-c-brand-dark); border: 1px solid var(--vp-c-brand-dark); border-radius:5px; padding: 1rem;">Stormy Linux is currently in its Alpha stage, but feel free to start using the Alpha dotfiles, the current config is capable of being used as a daily driver.</p>

## Overview

Stormy Linux, a Debian based distribution built as a tribute to the pet Russian white cat of W. Mouton, the creator of the distro. Stormy was a brave, gentle and intelligent cat born with `full heterochromia`. Stormy had green and blue eyes, with the right eye being green and the left eye being blue. After the unexpected passing of Stormy, the creator decided to build a project that could live on as a tribute to Stormy, and a Linux distribution was the perfect choice.

## Why Linux?

The creator of Stormy Linux is a Linux user and has been using it since the start of his programming journey. Linux functioned as a daily driver and go-to solution for software engineering and system architecture. Since Stormy's birth, the two were always together, practically inseparable. Even after the creator had to go away for 6 months, this bond only grew stonger. After returning home from a difficult 6 month journey, fearing that Stormy might have forgotten how close they were, to his surprise, his beloved pet remembered him and the two became closer than ever.

## Creator comment

> Since the start of my software engineering journey, Stormy has always been there, laying on my desk in front of my computer screen keeping me company as I was coding. I used to explain problems and solutions to him as he watched me and meowed at me like he understood what I was saying. 

> Stormy was the most intelligent pet I've ever raised, it was an honor and privilege to share an unbreakable bond with Stormy.


## Colors

The colors used in Stormy Linux is inspired by Stormy's beautiful marbel-like green and blue eyes.
