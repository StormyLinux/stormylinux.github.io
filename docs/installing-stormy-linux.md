# Installing Stormy Linux

## Installation

To install Stormy Linux, we must first install Debian 12 Stable.

It's relatively easy to get started, **Stormy Linux** is currently in beta and the current configuration is available for use, so to get started with your configuration of **Stormy Linux**, let's take a look at some of the steps we'll be covernig for the full installation.

- **Step 1** : Install Debian 12 Stable.
- **Step 2** : Install the Qtile window manager.
- **Step 3** : Install all the required applications.
- **Step 4** : Install the `JetbrainsMono` Nerd Font.
- **Step 5** : Make a backup of your Qtile configuration.
- **Step 6** : Clone the Stormy Linux dotfiles and replace the default config files.

## Start with Debian

Let's follow the steps...

Go to the official [Debian Website](https://debian.org) and download the latest Debian 12 Stable ISO.

For this installation, we will be using the a large complete installation image, which contains more packages we can use, especially if you have a machine without internet connection.

> Note: If you know how to install Debian you can use the "Net Install" image by clicking [here](https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/debian-12.2.0-amd64-netinst.iso).

The image we will be using is located at [https://debian.org/distrib](https://debian.org/distrib). You can also click [here](https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/bt-dvd/) to start downloading the image.

Once the image has downloaded, flash the ISO image to a USB, preferably one with 16GB of storage, but an 8GB USB should do.

## Flashing a USB

You can flash an image quickly on Linux using the below methods:

**Using dd**

```bash
sudo dd if=/PATH_TO_DEVICE of=~/PATH_TO_ISO status=progress
```

**Example**

```bash
sudo dd if=/dev/sdb of=~/StormyLinux/Downloads/Debian-12-Stable.iso status=progress
```

> Note: Balena Etcher is a great alternative to dd when flashing iso's to usb devices. Get balena etcher [here](https://etcher.balena.io). Windows users can leverage Rufus to flash usb devices. You can download rufus [here](https://rufus.ie/en)

After the iso has been flashed onto a USB, reboot your system and boot into the USB. Run the Debian installation.

After the Installation is complete, it's time to install what we need to get started with **Stormy Linux**.
