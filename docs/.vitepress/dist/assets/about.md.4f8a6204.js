Mouton, the creator of the distro. Stormy was a brave, gentle and intelligent cat born with <code>full heterochromia</code>. Stormy had green and blue eyes, with the right eye being green and the left eye being blue. After the unexpected passing of Stormy, the creator decided to build a project that could live on as a tribute to Stormy, and a Linux distribution was the perfect choice.</p><h2 id="why-linux" tabindex="-1">Why Linux? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-linux" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why Linux?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The creator of Stormy Linux is a Linux user and has been using it since the start of his programming journey. Linux functioned as a daily driver and go-to solution for software engineering and system architecture. Since Stormy&#39;s birth, the two were always together, practically inseparable. Even after the creator had to go away for 6 months, this bond only grew stonger. After returning home from a difficult 6 month journey, fearing that Stormy might have forgotten how close they were, to his surprise, his beloved pet remembered him and the two became closer than ever.</p><h2 id="creator-comment" tabindex="-1">Creator comment <a class="header-anchor" href="#creator-comment" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Creator comment&quot;">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>Since the start of my software engineering journey, Stormy has always been there, laying on my desk in front of my computer screen keeping me company as I was coding.
